# HopfieldNetworkCOMP5400

This is a repository that contains work done as a part of COMP5400 Bio-Inspired Computing.

The aim of our project was to explore Hopfield Networks.

Two use cases were explored:
1. Handwriting recognition using MNIST dataset
2. Solving Sudoku Puzzles

These can be found in their respective folders with their own README files containing further descriptions.
